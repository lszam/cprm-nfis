### Why magnetic data for water resources?
Magnetic data is one of the most common geophysical tools for geological mapping. This work is foccused on fractured aquifers related to mafic intrusions, and have attention on damage zones of dykes. Therefore, magnetic data was filtered in order to highlight such magnetic rocks.
### Objective 
Generating geohysical data for aplication in hidrological studies, due to further multidiciplinary groundwater flow modeling.
