### Why magnetic data for water resources?
Magnetic data is one of the most common geophysical tools for geological mapping. This work is foccused on fractured aquifers related to dykes (Cavalcanti et al., 2020), which are highly anomalous on magnetic data. Therefore, magnetic data was filtered in order to highlight such magnetic rocks.
### Objective 
Generating geohysical data for aplication in hidrological studies, due to further multidiciplinary groundwater flow modeling.

### Data source
Updated in 14/11/2021 - Magnetic data grids were created from the Paraná-Santa Catarina Aerogeophysical Project, Geological Survey of Brazil - CPRM (report: https://rigeo.cprm.gov.br/handle/doc/11241, source data: https://geosgb.cprm.gov.br/geosgb/downloads.html, summarized info: http://www.cprm.gov.br/aero/1000/CG109500.HTM).
The sample data was interpolated via Oasis Montaj software (https://www.seequent.com/products-solutions/geosoft-oasis-montaj/).
