#### Magnetic data processing applied for groundwater management in fractured aquifers.
###### Project: Supporting Sustainable Groundwater Supply Management in Brazil / Projeto: Apoiando o Abastecimento Sustentável de Água Subterrânea no Brasil (PIN2020141000001). This work is part of a internship report (Nov/2021). 
###### Fellow program: Newton International Fellowship Scheme (NFIS), Cooperação Fundo Newton - Confap). Intern: Luizemara Soares Alves Szameitat (luizemara@gmail.com). Coordinator: Oderson Antônio de Souza Filho (Geological Survey of Brazil, CPRM). Academic supervisor: Prof. Saulo Pomponet de Oliveira (Federal University of Parana, UFPR). Colaborator: Prof. Jeferson de Souza (Federal University of Parana, UFPR).

### Why magnetic data for water resources?
Magnetic data is one of the most common geophysical tools for geological mapping. This work is foccused on fractured aquifers related to dykes, which are highly anomalous on magnetic data. Therefore, magnetic data was filtered in order to highlight such magnetic rocks.
### Objective 
Generating geohysical data for aplication in hidrological studies, due to further multidiciplinary groundwater flow modeling.

## Data source
Updated in 14/11/2021 - Magnetic data grids were created from the Paraná-Santa Catarina Aerogeophysical Project, from the Geological Survey of Brazil - CPRM (report: https://rigeo.cprm.gov.br/handle/doc/11241, source data: https://geosgb.cprm.gov.br/geosgb/downloads.html, summarized info: http://www.cprm.gov.br/aero/1000/CG109500.HTM).
The data was interpolated via Oasis Montaj (https://www.seequent.com/products-solutions/geosoft-oasis-montaj/).
